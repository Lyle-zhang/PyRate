What is PyRate?
***************

PyRate is a `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ package that provides 
functionality for computing chemical reaction rates and other properties needed
for detailed kinetics models.

PyRate also uses the `Cython <http://www.cython.org/>`_ language -- an extension
of the Python language which adds syntax that makes it easy to tune the code
to obtain C-like execution speeeds -- to provide efficient implementations of
its classes and functions. This means that you don't have to choose between
the flexibility of Python and the efficiency of C/C++ et al. -- you get the
best of both worlds!
