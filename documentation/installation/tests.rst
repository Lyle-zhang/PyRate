**********************
Running the Unit Tests
**********************

PyRate comes with a large suite of unit tests that ensure functionality is
working as intended. To run these tests, first install PyRate or compile it
from source in-place using the directions in the previous section. Then, simply
invoke the entire suite of unit tests using ::

$ python setup.py test

This will run all of the unit tests in sequence, which may take some time. If
one or more unit tests fail, please report them on the GitHub issue tracker
(if they aren't already reported).
