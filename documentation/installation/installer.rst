Using a Package Installer
*************************

The easiest way to install PyRate is using an automatic package installer tool
such as ``pip`` (recommended) or ``easy_install``::

$ pip install pyrate

or ::

$ easy_install pyrate

The benefit of this approach is that all of the dependencies will be handled
automatically for you. All you need is a reasonably recent C compiler for
compiling the Cython modules.
